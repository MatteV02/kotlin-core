# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

For info about me or for contacting me you can use LinkedIn: [my personal page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matteo-veroni-31504019b/)

## Testing
Tests in this repository are made through [Kotest](https://kotest.io/). Each contribution should pass each test already existing and if they include new functionalities should include tests that verify them.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to kotlin-core](https://github.com/MatteV02/kotlin-core/pulls) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit, see the [commit list of this repo](https://github.com/MatteV02/kotlin-core/commits/main)).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. The code follows [Kotlin coding conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html).

Thanks,
Veroni Matteo
