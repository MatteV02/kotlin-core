## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can report a vulnerability by submitting a new issue on [this page](https://github.com/MatteV02/kotlin-core/issues). Please write the title of the issue as follows:
```
SECURITY: <description of the security issue>
```
Since this repository is a hobby for me, the security issue will be implemented ASAP, but I do not give you any guarantees about when the vulnerability will be patched.

I thank you for reporting any problem related to my project!
